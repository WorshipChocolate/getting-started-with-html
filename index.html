<h1><em><b>Unit 1</b></em></h1>
<b>Important Definitions</b>
<br>
<br> HTML(HyperText Mark-Up Language): the main document type of the web
<br> URL: how you refer to documents on the web
<br> HTTP: the protocol that unites the web; the web runs on this
<br> World Wide Web: a collection of HTML documents; files can be almost anything
<br> Browsers: Things like Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or Firefox
<br> Servers: Computers that host instead of doing the browsing. They host most of the files that make up the Web.
<br> Internet: the world's largest computer network
<br> Tag: a command contained within angled brackets. There are usually opening and closing tags. Some may not require closing. These are called Void Tags.
<br>Elements: everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
<br>Attribute: a property of a HTML element
<br>
<br><b>HTML</b>
<br>
<br>HTML, or HyperText Mark-Up Language, is the main document type of web. It is made of text content (what you see), mark-up what it looks like), references to other documents, and links to other pages. The HTML mark up is made of elements, which are made
of tags.
<br>
<br><b>Tags</b>
<br>
<br>In tags, there is an opening tag and an closing sign. Each is surrounding by greater/less than signs, which within dictate which command you are using. In between these tags are the words you wish to write. The only difference between an opening and closing
tag is the slash mark before the command. (Ex: /Name)
<br>
<br> There are many different types of tags. Here are the basic ones and their commands:
<br>
<br>B-Tag (Bold Tag), represented by a b.
<br> Em-Tag (Em. stands for emphasis; Italics), represented by em.
<br>
<br><b>HTML Attributes</b>
<br>
<br> Represented by tag ATTR= "value"; ending is /tag. The ATTR stands for attribute.
<br>
<br>A-Tag (Anchor Tag, links), represented by a href= "url" the closing tag is /a.
<br> Img-Tag (Image Tag, images), represented by img src= "url" alt= "text" This is a void tag. Void tags need no closing tags. The src stands for source, and alt stands for alternate. This part is "required"- it isn't really needed but you need to use it.
It is used for broken requests, and is also used when blind people use the computer.
<br>
<br><b>Whitespace</b>
<br>
<br> When typing in the elements, text ends up strung on one big line unless you use one of two specific commands.
<br>
<br>text on ----------------> text on multiple lines
<br>
<br>multiple lines
<br>
<br> Br-Tag (Break Tag, a line break; Void Tag), represented by br. Remember, Void Tags need no closing tag.
<br>
<br> P-Tag (Paragraph Tag, a block) represented by p. When you use this tag, a box seems to appear around the word selected, creating a slight line break where it is used. The length and width of the (invisible) tag can be changed to fit your needs.
<br>
<br><b>Inline VS Block</b>
<br>
<br> HTML documents are composed of two types of elements- inline or block. Block elements form an invisible box around the content.
<br>
<br> Inlines include: b, em, img, br, etc.
<br>
<br> HTML documents usually look much different than displayed on this page. Be warned! Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands, as one small problem can lead to bigger ones. Programmers can't remember everything either. There are
too many details to keep on your mind- if you need to google the tag for italics, don't feel ashamed!
